## About Easy MetaMask Onboarding dApp

This react dApp is based on the <a href="https://docs.metamask.io">MetaMask’s Developer documentation</a> and is intended to help developers who want to use MetaMask in their projects with as little friction as possible.

In easy way, we can have 4 different situations:

1. MetaMask browser extension is ***not installed***

2. MetaMask is ***installed, but not connected to the dApp***

3. MetaMask is ***installed and connected, but not on the right network***

4. MetaMask is installed, connected and is also on the right network ✔️

Each of this possible stages are catched and handled intuitively by the user directly in the UI.
